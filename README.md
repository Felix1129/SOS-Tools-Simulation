# SOS-Tools-Simulation
Matlab
SOSTOOLS is a free, third-party MATLAB1
toolbox for solving sum of squares programs. The
techniques behind it are based on the sum of squares decomposition for multivariate polynomials, which can be efficiently computed using semidefinite programming. 
SOSTOOLS is developed as a consequence of the recent interest in sum of squares polynomials 
partly due to the fact that these techniques provide convex relaxations for many hard problems such as global, constrained, and boolean optimization
